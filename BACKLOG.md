# Game Lab backlog

Claude works through this list on its own, a chunk at a time (a scheduled check-in
resumes the work every couple of hours). The owner can add, reorder or strike items
at any time; their word beats this list.

## How each work session goes
1. Read this file and CLAUDE.md. Pick the top unfinished item (or finish one in progress).
2. Do one meaningful, shippable chunk. Big items are split into milestones below.
3. `npm test && npm run build`, check it on a Pixel 7 screenshot, push the work branch,
   deploy to `main` only when it's finished and verified live.
4. Update this file: tick what's done, add what you learned or found, note the next step.
5. Tell the owner in a few lines what changed and what to try. Only ask a question if
   it truly needs their decision.

Ground rules: never break saves without bumping RULES_VERSION; never leave main red;
keep every change touch-friendly at 390 px; prefer depth and polish over sprawl.

## Now
- [ ] **Hexhold** (hex maze tower defense). Milestones:
  - [x] Core (src/hexhold/core): 9x11 hex board, flow-field pathing (never sealed), 30
        seeded waves with themes, 6 towers each gifting its neighbors, 8 enemies (flyers,
        armored brutes, menders, splitters, Colossus every 10th), replay, bot + 10 tests.
        Bot (scripts/hexhold/balance.ts) wins ~20/32 maps; losses are single-wave collapses
        to brute/flyer/splitter themes a human would see coming in the wave preview.
        Not done yet: tunnelers, tower specializations at level 3.
  - [x] Render + UI: build with a path preview, upgrade/sell, wave preview with the notable
        threat explained, 1-3x speed, saves mid-wave, results with damage by tower.
  - [x] Hub card, daily map, CLAUDE.md notes. Shipped.
  - [x] Level-3 specializations: each tower picks one of two forms (Longbow/Repeater,
        Siege/Cluster, Glacier/Hail, Storm/Overload, Inferno/Napalm, Banner/Lighthouse).
  - [x] Blind playtest and its fixes (rules v2): board no longer resizes under panels, tap
        guard after building, close buttons, warning when a build makes the path slip past
        towers, per-tower damage, Beacon/Frost stats, lives cost on wave chips, Colossus
        warning, gentler early waves + late-game hp growth, beacon levels matter, saves at
        wave end, softer hurt tint. Bot now median wave 27-28, ~1/4 wins.
  - [x] Burrowers (from wave 12, a few per wave: dig the straight route under towers, can't be
        hit while under one; their route shows as brown dots) and two-portal maps (~1/3 of seeds,
        +60 start gold, enemies alternate portals in small groups). Rules v3.
        `scripts/hexhold/probe.ts` shows where the bot dies by map shape.
  - [ ] Next ideas: a second blind playtest once owner feedback comes in; bot never builds Frost
        (2% damage) — check if Frost is weak or just unused by the bot.
- [x] **Blind playtests** for Rewild, Glyphwright, Telegraph, and their bug/UX fixes (shipped).
- [ ] **Design follow-ups from those playtests** (balance; need care, not quick fixes):
  - [x] Glyphwright gold sink (rules v2): **Empower** raises a rune a tier for gold (4×/10× its
    base cost, dearer than merging), rerolls cost 1,1,2,2,3… within a wave. Smart bot uses
    Empower; win rate unchanged (~32-35%). Still open: dps figure counts every pierce/arc
    target as always there; long spell names cut off in the row summary.
  - Telegraph: depths 1-3 are very easy (lunge one-shots 2-HP brutes); bomb badge sits on the
    player's hex when standing on a bomb.
  - Rewild: years 4-5 become upkeep (re-placing deer after wolves); losing a species costs
    little; beaver ponds and songbirds goals feel out of reach. Winter plants look alike.
    (Done: goals show ⚑ in the header, stars are only score stars.)
- [ ] **Unspoken art follow-ups** from its blind playtest: objects drawn over people in two
      riddle scenes (fire/bird over the elder); "river" acting reads as a sea wave.
- [ ] **Triad** (procedural logic puzzle). Fire burns leaf, leaf drinks water, water douses
      fire; a number counts the neighbors a hex beats. Milestones:
  - [x] Core: generator (unique, guess-free via single-clue deductions), hints from the same
        deductions, broken-clue check, 8 tests, `scripts/triad/stats.ts`.
  - [x] UI: hex board, element pad, notes, undo, hints (+30 s), timer, 3 sizes, daily, hub card.
  - [x] Blind playtest: an agent solved Small and Medium by reasoning alone, no hints needed
        ("genuinely good"). Fixes: hints name every clue that forces the hex, moves save at once,
        the clock includes hint penalties, filled numbered hexes keep a visible icon, finished
        numbers fade.
  - [ ] Next ideas: difficulty tiers
        (keep more clues for easy, allow two-clue deductions for hard), a short interactive
        tutorial puzzle, a second clue type (e.g. "beaten by" counts or edge marks).
- [ ] **Text adventure**: tap-driven interactive fiction with a small handcrafted world
      and systemic bits (inventory, NPC memory).

## Ideas (unscheduled)
- Unspoken: more story templates so the village tale varies; spoken pronunciation via
  speech synthesis; a harder "second village" with case markers or verb agreement.
- Hub: one shared settings panel (sound, vibration, reduced effects) used by every game.
- Afterglow: owner is happy with it — leave alone unless they report something.

## Done (recent)
- Glyphwright Empower + rising reroll cost; Rewild goals mark.
- Triad shipped (new logic puzzle game with daily).
- Blind playtest fixes: Telegraph (abandon confirm, hurting moves need the red button,
  auto-walk on cleared floors, stacked labels), Glyphwright (Reroll redraw bug, stale battle bar,
  false merge banner, merge warnings, what leaked), Rewild (saves on deal and after the end,
  species ± fixed, header and info panel room). Shared cards show a scroll hint.
- Hexhold: burrowers and two-portal maps.
- Hexhold blind playtest fixes (see above).
- Hexhold shipped: maze tower defense with neighbor gifts, 30 waves, daily map.
- Unspoken blind playtest (agent finished all 5 places: language "clicked" in ~2 minutes) and
  fixes: toast was a giant blank pill blocking taps (shell CSS order), category tabs crushed
  in busy sheets, new language on every reload, "one reading is off" hint, mural backdrop
  only for past scenes, riddles only use adjectives the art can show. RULES_VERSION 2.
- Unspoken shipped, then the journal-style UI refresh.
- Polish passes on Rewild, Glyphwright, Delve, Nightline, Telegraph, Grove, Lantern.
- Afterglow: death recap, Nights 1-5, weapon unions, Monoliths arena, mines/spitters fixes.
- Daily challenges for six games on the hub.

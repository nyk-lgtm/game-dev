# Game Lab — notes for Claude

A hub of small mobile web games: https://nyk-lgtm.github.io/game-dev/
(`index.html` + `src/hub/`), one folder per game: `telegraph/`, `grove/`, `lantern/`,
`afterglow/` (survivor-like), `delve/` (first-person ASCII crawler), `nightline/`
(pseudo-3D ASCII racer), `glyph/` (Glyphwright, spell-crafting autobattler), `rewild/`
(ecosystem builder on a hex island), `unspoken/` (learn a procedurally invented language from pictures), `hexhold/` (hex maze tower defense),
`triad/` (hex logic puzzle: fire/water/leaf, numbers count beaten neighbors), `lastlight/` (tap-driven interactive story).

- The owner plays and tests only on an Android phone (Chrome, portrait). Every UI
  change must work by touch at ~390 CSS px wide; tap targets ≥ 44px.
- Layout: `<game>/index.html` is the page; code in `src/<game>/` with a pure
  `core/` (rules), `render/`, controller `game.ts`, `main.ts`. Shared code in
  `src/shared/` (hex math, rng, storage with per-game prefixes, debug overlay,
  modal cards, timeline, hex layout, shell.css, settings: hub-wide sound/vibration, checked by
  afterglow/audio's Sfx and applied in installErrorOverlay). Tests in `tests/<game>/`,
  tools in `scripts/<game>/`.
- Adding a game: new `<game>/index.html`, `src/<game>/`, an entry in
  `vite.config.ts` (rollupOptions.input) and a card in `src/hub/main.ts`.
- Every `core/` must stay pure and deterministic (no DOM, no Math.random, no
  Date). All randomness flows from the seed via `Rng`/`mixSeed`; replays and bug
  reports depend on it. Bump a game's `RULES_VERSION` when old saves would replay
  differently.
- Before pushing: `npm test && npm run build`. Balance probes:
  - Telegraph: `npx vite-node scripts/telegraph/balance.ts 150` (greedy bot median
    depth ≈ 7, ~15% of runs end on depth 3; it can't plan bash/lunge combos). `scripts/telegraph/damage.ts`
    shows what hurts the player.
  - Grove: `npx vite-node scripts/grove/balance.ts 60` (score, game length, best tier; rules v2:
    median ~248 turns, Spirit Tree in ~half the games).
  - Lantern: `npx vite-node scripts/lantern/balance.ts 50` (completion bot: ~98% finish,
    level 7 at the king). Maps are hand-drawn strings in src/lantern/core/maps.ts;
    diagonal steps can't squeeze between two blocked cells, so never connect areas
    only diagonally.
  - Afterglow: `npx vite-node scripts/afterglow/balance.ts` (bot survival per character).
  - Delve: `npx vite-node scripts/delve/balance.ts`; Nightline: `npx vite-node scripts/nightline/balance.ts`.
  - Glyphwright: `npx vite-node scripts/glyph/balance.ts` (smart bot win rate, deaths per wave).
  - Hexhold: `npx vite-node scripts/hexhold/balance.ts 32` (heuristic bot: median wave ~27, ~8/32 wins);
    `scripts/hexhold/probe.ts 32` lists each loss with its wave and map shape (one or two portals).
  - Rewild: `npx vite-node scripts/rewild/balance.ts 16 greedy 1` (score, species, stars; compare
    with `random`; greedy median ~2100 with the settled bonus, stars at 900/1700/2400),
    `scripts/rewild/upto.ts <seed> <n>` (a bot game's actions to season n, for `?seed=&a=`), `scripts/rewild/probe.ts` (plays and causes of death), `trace.ts <seed>`.
- ASCII games (Delve, Nightline) draw into a character `Grid` (src/shared/ascii.ts) painted
  with batched `fillText` runs; art lives in each game's `art.ts`.
- Daily challenges (src/shared/daily.ts): `<game>/?daily` plays today's seed (`dailySeed(game, day)`,
  local date); each game keeps its in-progress daily under `dailyRun` and today's best under `daily`.
  Wired for Afterglow, Rewild, Glyphwright, Delve, Nightline, Unspoken, Hexhold and Triad; the hub's Daily section links them.
- Afterglow extras: Nights 1-5 (`NIGHTS` in content.ts, unlocked by `profile.nightsWon`), arenas
  (`ARENAS`/pillars in core/arena.ts, hashed from the seed), unions (`union` on a WeaponDef: two
  maxed weapons merge in a chest), and player damage is attributed (`w.taken`, `w.killedBy`).
  `NIGHT=n ARENA=1 npx vite-node scripts/afterglow/probe.ts` probes them.
- Glyphwright runs are a seed + build actions (`B`uy/`M`ove/`S`ell/`R`eroll/`F`reeze/`G`o);
  battles are deterministic, so `replay(seed, a)` rebuilds the run.
- Rewild runs are a seed + actions (`P<card>.<cell>` place, `R` new hand, `E` end season). The
  season sim (src/rewild/core/sim.ts) visits cells in index order with one Rng per season, so
  the UI's forecasts (clone + end season) are exact.
- Unspoken: `makeLanguage(seed)` (core/lang.ts) invents grammar, sounds and glyphs; `makeWorld` builds
  5 chapters of authored scenes (every word in 2+ scenes; tests enforce it) plus generated riddles; state
  actions are `G<glyph>=<guess>` and `A<challenge>~p<n>` / `~<tile.tile…>`. Scene art: render/scene.ts.
  `npx vite-node scripts/unspoken/inspect.ts <seed>` prints a language and its world.
- Hexhold runs are a seed + tick-stamped actions (`<tick>:B<cell>.<tower>`, `U`, `S`, `W`); enemies follow a
  flow field (src/hexhold/core/board.ts) rebuilt on every build/sell; `buildError` forbids sealing any portal. Flyers use `FLY_DIST`, burrowers
  `s.dig` (the tower-less field); `distFor` picks. ~1/3 of maps have two portals (`s.portals`).
- Triad (src/triad/core/puzzle.ts): `generate(seed, radius)` fills a random answer, adds givens until
  single-clue deductions (`propagate`, exact per clue via `clueSupport`) finish it, then strips clues and
  givens while they still do; so every puzzle is unique and guess-free, and `nextHint` replays those
  deductions. Levels: Easy keeps more numbers; Hard strips further while `propagateDeep` ("what if" trials,
  capped at 2+2·radius) still finishes it. `npx vite-node scripts/triad/stats.ts 30` shows counts per size/level.
- Last Light (src/lastlight/core/story.ts): `choices(s)` lists legal action ids (`go:<room>`, `take:<item>`,
  `use:<item>:<target>`, `give:`, `say:<npc>:<topic>`, …); `act(s, id)` returns the text. A run is the list of
  ids (saved; `?a=` replays). tests/lastlight has the best route — update it when the story changes.
- Telegraph specifics: new enemies go in `ENEMIES` (src/telegraph/core/enemies.ts)
  plus a shape in render/draw.ts and a color in palette.ts; tests in
  tests/telegraph/enemies.test.ts. Telegraphed attacks set `aim` and resolve via
  `release` at the start of the next enemy phase; a releasing enemy skips `act`.
- Visual check: build, `npx vite preview`, screenshot with Playwright using the
  `Pixel 7` device profile. `window.__game` exposes each game's controller.
- Bug reports from the owner look like `TELEGRAPH …`/`GROVE …`/`LANTERN …`/`GLYPH …`/`REWILD … seed=… a=…` (and the other games' equivalents);
  reproduce with that game's `replay(seed, a)` or `<game>/?seed=…&a=…`.
- The live site deploys only from `main` (CI pushes `dist/` to `gh-pages`);
  other branches just build and test.
  If a push's CI run sits "queued" for long (it happened once for 2h), start `deploy.yml` by hand
  (workflow_dispatch on `main`); it can't be cancelled while stuck.
- Autonomous work: read BACKLOG.md first; it holds the queue, the per-session routine and what's done.
- When shipping something the owner would notice, add a line at the top of `NEWS` in src/hub/news.ts
  (the hub's "What's new", which marks items newer than their last visit).
